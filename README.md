# arduinoSerialController
Code for my MemmoCS2 final project

Special thanks to Trevor Nelson for help with jinput and manipulating bytes

## The Code
See SerialControlDemo for the Arduino code, and src/drive/ for the java code

if you want to run the code, make sure to add ` -D java.library.path=jinput-2.0.9 ` to your VM arguments
